# Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

[//]: # (excludeFromIndex)

We introduce the alpha version of the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3.x+ IDE variants. It is compatible with 2025.x and
should be compatible with other IDEA flavors, notably [OpenIDE](https://openide.ru/). It supports the following features:

- syntax highlighting (2 stage, fast and more accurate that analyses in background)
- reformat code (indents, spaces)
- reformat on paste
- smart enter key

Features are configurable via the plugin settings page, in system settings.

> Recommended for IntelliJ-based IDEs: While IntelliJ can import TextMate bundles
> (Settings/Preferences → Editor → TextMate Bundles), the native Lyng plugin provides
> better support (formatting, smart enter, background analysis, etc.). Prefer installing
> this plugin over using a TextMate bundle.

### Install

- From ZIP: download the archive below, then in IntelliJ IDEA open Settings/Preferences → Plugins →
  gear icon → Install Plugin from Disk… and select the downloaded ZIP. Restart IDE if prompted.
- Alternatively, if/when the plugin is published to a marketplace, you will be able to install it
  directly from the “Marketplace” tab (not yet available).
